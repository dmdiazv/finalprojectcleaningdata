Final project coursera course of getting and cleaning data

Final Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project This repository includes Diego Diaz's submission of the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. This README file has instructions on how to run an analysis on the Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (UCI HAR Dataset)

Files CodeBook.md This document describes the variables, the data, and transformations as well as worked undertaken to tidy the data

The run_analysis.R script performs all the data preparation code. It includes 5 parts mostly following the course requirements. Such parts are as follows:

Part 1. Establishes the preliminary steps to address cleaning the data: it focuses on how to download and load the data 
Part 2. It focuses to merge the data to get one data set. 
Part 3. It Extracts the mean and STD of the merged data. 
Part 4. It Uses descriptive activity names to identify variables. 
Part 5. It Establishes appropriate name labels for data - This mainly involves removing strange characters in column names. Part 6. It Creates a second independent dataset fully tidy and calculates the mean and SDT. This last data set fully organised can be found as files called "Finaldataset.txt" The file above will be contained in the project's working directory. The "Finaldataset.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
